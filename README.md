# MOREL
Source code for the paper titled "MOREL: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness through Multi-Objective Representation Learning".

We propose MOREL, a method to improve deep neural network robustness against adversarial attacks using a multi-objective approach to align natural and adversarial features during training, improving the accuracy-robustness trade-off. To run this project, you need to have the `adversarial-robustness-toolbox` package installed.
