We propose MOREL, a method to improve deep neural network robustness against adversarial attacks using a multi-objective optimization approach. Our training method involves an embedding space where cosine similarity loss and multi-positive contrastive loss are used to align natural and adversarial features from the model encoder and ensure tight clustering.

To run this project, you need to have the [`adversarial-robustness-toolbox`](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox) package installed.
